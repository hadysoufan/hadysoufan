# Hi, I'm Hadi! 👋
I am a web developer who has potential in both frontend (client-side) applications and backend (server-side) systems. I am capable of creating full websites. I feel at ease working with the reactJS frontend framework and Django for the backend. Additionally, in my leisure time, I post technical articles to my Medium account.


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a student majoring in computer science, which is the systematic study of computation and its applications. Algorithms, programming languages, computer systems and architecture, data structures, databases, software engineering, and other subjects are all covered under my major.I'm a student majoring in computer science, which is the systematic study of computation and its applications.
