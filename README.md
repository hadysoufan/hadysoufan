# Hi, I'm Hadi! 👋
I am a web developer who has potential in both frontend (client-side) applications and backend (server-side) systems. I am capable of creating full websites. I feel at ease working with the reactJS frontend framework and Django for the backend. Additionally, in my leisure time, I post technical articles to my Medium account.


## 🚀 About Me

Algorithms, programming languages, computer systems and architecture, data structures, databases, software engineering, and other subjects are all covered under my major.I'm a student majoring in computer science, which is the systematic study of computation and its applications.
